#Program Title: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Compound Data Types
#Program Function:
#(1) Make a short quiz program that uses a dictionary for its questions and answers.
#(1a) Create a dictionary with at least five key:value pairs to store the questions and answers.
#(1b) In a loop, ask questions based on the key values. 
#(1c) Allow the user to input the answers.
#(1d) Keep track of the score and, when all of the questions have been asked, tell print the final quiz score.

#Make two sets here
List1 = ["hamburger","pizza","fries","tuna"]
Tuple1 = ("beef","pork","salad","vegetables")

List1[0] = "noddles"
List1.append("fruit")
print(List1)
List1.pop(1)
print(List1)
List1.reverse()
print(List1)

print ('O-(///￣皿￣)☞ ─═≡☆゜★█▇▆▅▄...')
