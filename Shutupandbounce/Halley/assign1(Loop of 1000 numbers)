          For each number that is dividible by 19, print "Multiple of 19!!"
 Variable number : i
"""
#get a range loop through 1000 numbers
for i in range(0,1000):
#for divisible by 3 and multiple of 19 by if statement
    if i % 3 == 0:
        print('Divisible by 3')
    elif i % 19 == 0:
        print('Multiple pf 19!!')
    else:
        print(i)
