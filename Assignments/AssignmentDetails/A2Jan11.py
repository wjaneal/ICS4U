#Type casting
x = 5  #This is an integer
y = 6  #This is also an integer
a = 5.0 #This is a floating point number
b = 6.0 #This is too

xstring = str(x) #Typecast x into a string
print("The length of the side is "+xstring)

print(x/y)
print(a/b)
print(x/y+a/b)
print (int(a/b)) #This converts the number back to an integer
