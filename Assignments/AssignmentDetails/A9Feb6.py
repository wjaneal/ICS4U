Assignment 9 - Benchmarking Algorithms


Coding convention: 
(a) lower case file name
(b) Name, Date, Title, Purpose in multiline comment at the beginning
(c) mixedCase variable names

(1) Create two functions: prime1(n) and prime2(n) that take a number that represents the set of integers from which to find prime numbers.  For example, n=1000 specifies that the function will look for primes up to 1000.
(2) Find out how to measure elapsed time in Python
(3) Write a program that determines the amount of time taken to find primes up to the following values: n=[10000,20000,30000,40000,50000]
(4) Output of the program:
First algorithm:
n	time
10000	2.23
20000	4.67
30000 	7.88
40000	11.34
50000	14.44

Second algorithm:
n	time
10000	2.23
20000	14.67
30000 	117.88
40000	211.34
50000	11214.44

(5) Bonus:  Have Python graph the results using pyplot / matplotlib
