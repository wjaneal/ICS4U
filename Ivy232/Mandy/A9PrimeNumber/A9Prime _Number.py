!notice: Here in "A9" I defined two functions which is called P1 and P3.
         In "A9_2", I added one more function P2 (which is quite slow).

#Program Title: A9 (Primes, time, *plot)

(1) Create two functions: prime1(n) and prime2(n) that take a number that represents the set of integers from which to find prime numbers.  For example, n=1000 specifies that the function will look for primes up to 1000.
(2) Find out how to measure elapsed time in Python
(3) Write a program that determines the amount of time taken to find primes up to the following values: n=[10000,20000,30000,40000,50000]
(4) Output of the program:
First algorithm:
n       time
10000   2.23
20000   4.67
30000   7.88
40000   11.34
50000   14.44
