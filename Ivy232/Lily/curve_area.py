#Program Title: Area Calculator
#Program Function: This program calcuates the area under curves (mathematical functions)
import math
#Variables:
a = 1.0 #This is the starting x value
b = 5.0 #This is the ending x value
n = 1000000 #This is the number of rectangles
Area = 0.0 #This is the total area

#This is the function to use in the area calculation
def f(x):
    return x*x


for i in range(1,n+1):
    #Find xi, the current x value
    xi = a+i*(b-a)/n 
    #Find the area of the rectangle, Ai, using the function
    Ai = f(xi)*((b-a)/n)
    #Add it to the total area, "Area"
    Area += Ai
#Print the area here
print (Area)
