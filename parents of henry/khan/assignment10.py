Assignment 10 - Benchmarking Sorting Algorithms


name:khan
date:20180218
program title:assignment 10
purpose:
(1) Create a class with functions for three sorting algorithms - bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort. 
(2) Write a program that determines the amount of time taken to sort lists of random numbers of the following lenghs: n=[10000,20000,30000,40000,50000]
(3) Output of the program:
Bubble sort algorithm:
n	time
10000	2.23
20000	4.67
30000 	7.88
40000	11.34
50000	14.44

Insertion sort algorithm:
n	time
10000	2.23
20000	14.67
30000 	117.88
40000	211.34
50000	11214.44


Selection Sort algorithm:
n	time
10000	1.4
20000 	4.5
30000	10.4
40000	29.3
50000	100.2

(4) Have Python graph the results using pyplot / matplotlib
Variables: List,i,start,elapsed,Text,sort.t1,sort.t2,sort.t3,index,position,currentValue,positionOfMax,Location,N,Nlist
