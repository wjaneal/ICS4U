Program Title: Linear, Random and Binary Searching - Benchmarking

Purpose:

(1) Create a class with functions for three search algorithms - random, linear and binary.
(2) Write a program that determines the amount of time taken to search lists of 1000000 random numbers.
(3) Sample output of the program:
Random search algorithm:
trial#	time
1	2.23
2	2.67
3 	2.88
4       2.92
5	2.11
Average: 2.56


Linear Search Algorithm:
trial#	time
1	3.45
2	3.97
3 	3.21
4	1.23
5	2.23
Average ...


Binary Search algorithm:
trial#	time
1	0.56
2 	0.87
3	0.23
4	0.34
5	0.12
Average ....
