#Python coding conventions and documentation standards
#Python coding conventions:(from Python Software Foundation)
'''
A tab should be used when indenting
Imports should usually be on separate lines
Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.
Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations: Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces;Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon
Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc.), comparisons (==, <, >, !=, <>, <=, >=, in, not in, is, is not), Booleans (and, or, not).
Leave one blank line between different functions
Leave two blank lines between different classes
